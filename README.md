Python script to send a message to Discord using webhook when DND Beyond services are affected by monitoring https://status.dndbeyond.com/.

Add the scret DISCORD_WWBHOOK with the webhook URL you want to use.

Run using Github Actions, with the workflow being triggered every 5 minutes. Note that this does not guarantee a run every 5 minutes, see https://upptime.js.org/blog/2021/01/22/github-actions-schedule-not-working

This script is mostly the work of chatGPT and Copilot, use at your own risk.
